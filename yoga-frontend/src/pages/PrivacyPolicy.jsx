        <p>
          HEALTHY HORIZONS collects certain information from the User’s browser
          using small data files called “cookies.” HEALTHY HORIZONS uses session
          ID cookies to confirm that customers are logged in. This type of
          cookie helps HEALTHY HORIZONS recognize a customer if he or she visits
          multiple pages on the Website during the same session, so that
          separate passwords are not required to access each page. These cookies
          terminate once the customer closes the browser. By default, HEALTHY
          HORIZONS uses a persistent cookie that stores customer login ID (but
          not password) to make it easier for the customer to login when
          returning to the Website. HEALTHY HORIZONS encodes its cookies so that
          only HEALTHY HORIZONS can interpret the information stored in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          HEALTHY HORIZONS also stores transaction history. HEALTHY HORIZONS may
          collect additional information in ways not specifically described
          herein. For example, HEALTHY HORIZONS may track information related to
          interactions with customer service or responses from surveys or other
          feedback tools. HEALTHY HORIZONS uses this information to continually
          improve the service provided to the customers.
        </p>

          HEALTHY HORIZONS’s Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by
          its partners and affiliates. HEALTHY HORIZONS does not have access or
          control over these cookies. HEALTHY HORIZONS’s partners and affiliates
          may use session ID cookies to provide a custom user experience and to
          track the success of HEALTHY HORIZONS’s partnership with them.
